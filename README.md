KudosU is a revolutionary web app to be deployed in secondary schools in Singapore to help democratize recognition through peer affirmation.

Students and teachers can send positive notes of affirmations (and include images should they so choose) to their fellow peers; this helps mitigate the negative self-talk and stress they might face due to duress, burnout or mental drain from exams or tasks.

Through KudosU, secondary school environments can be made more positive, conducive and encouraging, resulting in significant improvements when it comes to mental well-being and quantitative performance at work.

## Frontend

The frontend for KudosU is a Vite-built React app. It communicates with the backend via `axios`.

A combination of several UI libraries and components are used:
- Chakra UI
- shadcn
- Material UI
- Tailwind CSS

## Backend

Backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Prakhar896/KudosU-Backend).
